goblin-website
==============

Repository for goblin's official website.

This is a work in progress, and you're help would be amazing!

##How to Run
1. Clone the repository to a folder (or download it).
2. Navigate to it on the command line.
3. Run 'npm install' to install all the dependencies.
4. Run 'node .' (or 'nodejs .' if on Ubuntu Linux)
5. Visit localhost:8000 in your browser and you'll see the website running!

##Version
This website runs on Goblin v0.0.2

##Database
I have publically connect this to an official instance on IrisCouch -- goblin.iriscouch.com -- and have included
the credientials in the repository.

Of course, you can switch this out, and when it's in production, I will be changing this (it may also get crazy with more contributors!) but I thought the excitement of getting goblin up in running on your computer in 4 steps and no DB setup would be worth it, at least for now!
